# Graph_KB

Proposed, realized by: Kentour Mohamed & Mihoubi Salah

Graph transformation can visualize the dynamic evolution of complex systems because it allows to design the system on several levels of abstraction. However, existing transformation tools neglect the verification process that accompanies the transformation process, in this sense the description logics seem the preferred targets to operationalize these tools.

In this project, we targeted the best known transformation tool which is AGG (Attributed Graph Grammar), by analyzing this tool (parser.java), we were able to create a transformation engine to formalize the different aspects of the transformation (source graph, target graph, rules and application conditions), see (KB.java).
